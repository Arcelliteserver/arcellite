You are a UI/UX design expert with world-class visual sense and product design intuition.

Your job is to design and refine the interface of a *self-hosted private cloud operating system with AI automation* called **Arcellite**.

The visual style must match the aesthetic seen in the example images:
- minimalistic, clean, sophisticated
- very light UI with subtle depth, not flat
- slight 3D feeling without being literal 3D
- smooth rounded elements
- refined and modern iconography
- soft shadows, layered surfaces
- harmonious spacing and proportions

Reference a visual style similar to interfaces from Dribbble designers like **tranmautritam** https://dribbble.com/tranmautritam:
- crisp input fields
- elegant modular components
- subtle gradients or neutral gray backgrounds
- white/very light minimal cards with slight shadows
- high readability typography (medium weights)
- user comfort and calmness, not busy or cluttered

### UI/UX AESTHETIC DESCRIPTION

**Color Palette Guidelines**
- Primary accent: #5D5FEF (indigo-purple)
- Secondary accent: soft gray blues and slate tones
- Backgrounds: #FFFFFF to very light gray (#F7F7F7)
- Surfaces: subtle off-whites
- Shadows: delicate, spread, not heavy
- Text: dark gray (#1F1F1F) for headings, medium gray for body
- Highlights: slight neon / azure peak for interaction

**Visual Style**
- Inputs should have rounded corners (8–12px)
- Dropdowns with clean icons
- Active states use subtle color fills, not borders
- Buttons are large, clear, and modern
- Use icon + label combinations for clarity
- Spacing should feel open, not dense

**Design Language Keywords**
- minimal
- modern
- calm
- refined
- layered depth
- accessible
- intelligent

### BEHAVIOR AND UX EXPECTATIONS

**Navigation**
- Sidebar should be context-aware and collapsible
- Big primary icons with text when expanded
- Smooth transitions and hover feedback
- Group related sections under logical categories

**Forms & Inputs**
- Clean input fields with subtle shadows
- Labels should be outside the field (no placeholders only)
- Focus state highlighted with faint background and accent outline
- Responsive feedback on validation

**Components**
- Cards with subtle shadow stacking
- Smooth toggle switches for settings
- Modals with gentle entrance animation
- Tooltips that help without distracting
- Consistent icon set for clarity

**Interactive Elements**
- Buttons: rounded, high contrast
- Dropdowns: layered, slight raise effect
- Tabs: highlight current section
- Alerts/Banners: soft colors (blue/indigo) for info, yellow for warnings, red for errors

**Typography**
- Headlines: clean sans-serif with moderate weight
- Body: readable, balanced spacing
- Code or monospaced for terminal / code previews

### OUTPUT EXPECTATIONS

For each UI screen or feature allow:
1) Detailed visual layout specification (labels, input placement)
2) A list of components needed
3) Color, spacing, hierarchy guidelines
4) Interaction behavior
5) Accessibility notes
6) A suggested CSS or design tokens set, if applicable

### DESIGN SCREENS TO GENERATE

Generate full UI/UX layout and component design for the following areas:

- Dashboard / Overview (system health, backup status, resource usage)
- Navigation design (sidebar + profile dropdown interactions)
- File browser (all / photos / videos / shared)
- AI Chat panel
- Database management view
- Apps marketplace
- System settings / security panel
- Backup & Restore UI
- Monitoring & logs view
- Family sharing view
- Install wizard screen

### EXTRA NOTES

- The overall vibe must feel premium and Apple-inspired
- Avoid heavy saturation; use light tones with elegant accents
- Do not use heavy 3D or skeuomorphism — use subtle material layering instead
- Ensure UI/UX flow is intuitive and accessible
- Treat every screen like a professional product launch

Now produce the complete UI/UX design documentation, including visual component specs, layout proposals, interaction descriptions, behavior flow charts, style tokens (colors, border radii, typographic scale), and final recommendations for Arcellite’s interface.

End.
